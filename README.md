+ Project summary: In this project, we implemented two algorithms for fair classification: Learning Fair Representations (LFR) and Maximizing Fairness under Accuracy Constraints (Gamma and Fine-gamma). Both algorithms aim to balance fairness and accuracy in classification tasks. We evaluated the performance of these algorithms using various metrics, including accuracy, parity, and equality of odds. Our results suggest that these algorithms can effectively promote fairness while maintaining reasonable levels of accuracy.

**Contribution statement**: The project team made significant contributions towards the completion of the project. Chenghao Lu and Ranran Tao contributed to the construction of Algorithm 3, while Haoyu He, Aubrey Yan, and Xinyu Zhu worked on the development of Algorithm 1. Ranran Tao helped in integrating both parts, Chenghao Lu and Aubrey Yan assisted in revising the code to ensure its accuracy and efficiency, Xinyu Zhu was in charge of creating the presentation slides, Haoyu He took responsibility for the introduction and conclusion of the project, while Wen Chen made the final presentation. Together, the team successfully completed the project and demonstrated excellent teamwork, communication, and collaboration skills.
